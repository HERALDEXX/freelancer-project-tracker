Title: Freelancer Project Tracker

Scenario:
I'm building a MySQL database called `freelancer_db` to help freelancers track their clients, projects, and payments. The goal is to organize information about which clients the freelancer is working with, details about each project (budgets, deadlines, descriptions), and whether payments have been made. This helps freelancers monitor work progress and manage income effectively.
